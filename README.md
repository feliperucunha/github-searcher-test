### 📝 Improvement Notes

I knew I could complete what you were asking for, but to me this is a barebone version. It is more than what you asked for sure, but if I had more time to work on this project (due to Christmas) I would:
- Replace the strings with locales variables.
- Use TypeScript.
- Add more tests.
- Improve the testing complexity.
- Handle more errors.
- Improve the performance.
- Maybe make it a little prettier.
